Name

   SDIFDisplay --  Display the contents of an SDIF file.
   
Synopsis

   SDIFDisplay {file}
   
Description

   SDIFDisplay displays the contents of the specified SDIF file. SDIF
   stands for Sound Description Interchange Format. Currently SDIFDisplay
   displays the following SDIF Standard Frame Types:
   
   1FQ0 Fundamental Frequency Estimate
   1STF Discrete Short-Term Fourier Transform
   1TRC Sinusoidal Tracks
   
   SDIF and the SDIF Standard Frame Types are described at the [1]CNMAT
   SDIF Homepage .
   
Graphical User Interface

   The SDIFDisplay window is divided into groups, each containing a
   visual representation of an SDIF stream. Each group has it's own
   horizontal and vertical scrollbars. Note that these scrollbars can be
   used for both scrolling and zooming: When the thumb in grabbed in the
   middle, the slider scrolls, when grabbed at the top or buttom, it
   changes zoom. The vertical scale can be increased even more with a
   special button. When a horizontal scrollbar is used while pressing the
   Control key, the other horizontal scrollbars follow it.
   
   The color scale of each group can be controled, in order to see parts
   of the data that otherwise would be too dark.
   
Limitations

   This version of SDIFDisplay expects SDIF files that contain only one
   stream per SDIF Standard Frame Type. Please send feedbacks and
   bug-reports to the author.
