.SH NAME
SDIFDisplay \- Display the contents of an SDIF file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBSDIFDisplay\fR \fBfile\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBSDIFDisplay\fR displays the contents of the specified SDIF file. SDIF stands for Sound Description Interchange Format. Currently \fBSDIFDisplay\fR displays the following SDIF Standard Frame Types:

1FQ0

Fundamental Frequency Estimate

1STF

Discrete Short-Term Fourier Transform

1TRC

Sinusoidal Tracks
SDIF and the SDIF Standard Frame Types are described at the 
\fICNMAT SDIF Homepage\fR
 <URL:http://cnmat.CNMAT.Berkeley.EDU/SDIF/>.
.SS "GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE"
.PP
The \fBSDIFDisplay\fR window is divided into groups, each containing a visual representation of an SDIF stream. Each group has it's own horizontal and vertical scrollbars. Note that these scrollbars can be used for both scrolling and zooming: When the thumb in grabbed in the middle, the slider scrolls, when grabbed at the top or buttom, it changes zoom. The vertical scale can be increased even more with a special button. When a horizontal scrollbar is used while pressing the \fBControl\fR key, the other horizontal scrollbars follow it.
.PP
The color scale of each group can be controled, in order to see parts of the data that otherwise would be too dark.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.PP
This version of \fBSDIFDisplay\fR expects SDIF files that contain only one stream per SDIF Standard Frame Type.
